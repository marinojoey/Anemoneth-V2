#### A Web3 Social Media that __frictionlessly__ makes each user a shareholder     

---
## What problem do we solve?
Every social media platform begins with a sole focus on user experience. That focus is slowly forced to shift though. To make it erroneously simple, a founder's path is:
1. An idea sparks 
2. That idea find success and seeks/attracts external funding 
3. The companies priorities naturally, slowly and diminutively shift way from the user and towards shareholder returns  

At Anemoneth we believe that this is both unavoidable and a __good__ thing! A business should absolutely seek to reward its shareholders. The problem however, is that these shareholders have always been a small, powerful and distinctly seperate group when compared to the users. This foundational crack has repeatedly proven to breed distrust within those users and often results in abandonment. Our goal is not to remove external investors, but rather to game theoretically align those investors with every user of the platform.

## How do we solve this mis-alignment?
Our express goal is to make each user a financial stakeholder both __natively__ and __seamlessly__. AnemonETH accomplishes this by programatically rewarding users whenever they recieve upvotes with FISH - our ERC20 token. This results in users retaining the value they create while simultaneously enriching the platform as whole. While we will largely operate as a traditional company (i.e. seek/require external funding), it is hard to understate just how crucial this re-alignment is for a social media platform
* It attracts and empowers the best creators
* It establishes organic trust with users
* It provides an assymetric opportunity for investors

## Why will AnemonETH be successful?
AnemonETH is designed with 3 primary assumptions of its users/target market:
* They are rational
* They are self-interested
* They are not yet web3 or crypto native

Within traditional social media platforms, financial investors are undoubtedly the primary benefactors. That is not to say that users do not benefit though! The connectivity, convenience and services offered by these platforms speaks for itself. Users may even recognize the value they are sacrificing to the platform but continue using it because that cost is worth it to them. After all, each time a rational, self-interested user logs-in they are implicitely deciding it is __worth it__.

We strongly beleive that all else being equal users will choose the platform that most benefits them. This means providing the same convenience, services and network as traditional platforms while also offering what they fundamentally cannot. 

## What are our biggest challenges?
* Effectively non-existent Web3 engagement from the larger population
* Communication of AnemonETH's conept/benefits
* Limited network effects of a newly founded social media

Anemoneth is designed with these issues in mind. The largest problem we face is accessing a general public who is ill-informed about web3/De-Fi. Establishing an active userbase for a web3 social platform will be our biggest challenge. However, this is also a massive opportunity. In the Crypto/De-Fi space, Anemoneth provides tangible utility while being approachable and easy to understand. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to be the exact service that introduces people to web3. Being able to provide an honest, succinct and Anemoneth-focused introduction to web3, while acknowledging it is a core necessity, is a powerful responsibility.
