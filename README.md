#### A Web3 Social Media that __frictionlessly__ makes each user a shareholder     
&nbsp;

## What problem do we solve?
Every social media platform begins with a sole focus on user experience. That focus slowly shifts though. To make it erroneously simple, a founder's path is:
1. An idea sparks 
2. That idea find success and seeks/attracts external funding 
3. The companies priorities naturally, slowly and diminutively shift way from the user and towards shareholder returns  

At Anemoneth we believe that this is both unavoidable and a __good__ thing! A business should absolutely seek to reward its shareholders. The problem however, is that these shareholders have always been a small, powerful and distinctly seperate group compared to the users. They are not at odds necessarily, but their goals are slightly mis-aligned. This foundational crack has repeatedly proven to breed distrust within the users and often results in abandonment. Our goal is not to remove external investors, but rather to game theoretically align every user of the platform with the external investors.

## How do we solve this mis-alignment?
Our express goal is to make each user a financial stakeholder both __natively__ and __seamlessly__. AnemonETH accomplishes this by programatically rewarding users whenever they create value with FISH - our ERC20 token. This results in users retaining their value while simultaneously enriching the platform as whole. While we will largely operate as a traditional company (i.e. seek/require external funding), it is hard to understate just how crucial this re-alignment is. Especially for a social media platform.
* It attracts and empowers the best creators
* It establishes organic trust with users
* It provides an assymetric opportunity for any class of investors

## Why will AnemonETH be successful?
AnemonETH is designed with 3 primary assumptions of its users/target market:
* They are rational
* They are self-interested
* They are not yet web3 or crypto native

In traditional social platforms, the main benefactors are clearly the financial investors. That is not to say that users do not benefit though! The connectivity, convenience and services offered by web2 social platforms was revolutionary. Users may even recognize the value they surrender to the platform but continue using it. That cost is worth it to them. After all, each time a rational, self-interested user logs-in they are implicitely deciding it is __worth it__.

We strongly beleive that all else being equal users will choose the platform that most benefits them. This means providing the same convenience, services and network as web2 platforms while also offering what they fundamentally cannot. 

## What are our biggest challenges?
* Effectively non-existent Web3 engagement from the larger population
* Communication of AnemonETH's conept/benefits
* Limited network effects of a newly founded social media

Anemoneth is designed with these issues in mind. The largest problem we face is accessing a general public who is ill-informed about web3. Establishing an active userbase for a web3 native social platform will be our biggest challenge. However, this is also a massive opportunity. In the Crypto/De-Fi space, Anemoneth provides tangible utility while being approachable and easy to understand. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to on-board people to web3. Being able to provide an honest, succinct and Anemoneth-focused introduction to web3 (and acknowledging it's necessity) is a powerful position to be in.
